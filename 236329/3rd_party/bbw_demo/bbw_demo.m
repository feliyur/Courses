% full solution which solve for all weights simultaneously and enforce
% partition of unity as a proper contstraint.

% Compute weights

  % if mosek is installed this is the fastest option

  % else this uses the default matlab quadratic programming solver

% Deform mesh via controls
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Display mesh and control points and allow user to interactively deform mesh
% and view weight visualizations

% Commented out are examples of how to call "simple_deform.m" with various options
